## Introduction

During my 10 years of web development, the most helpful thing to me has always been great guides by the community.

Today, I am launching my first project centered around getting started with new languages and frameworks. [Getting Started guides](http://getting-started.md). Getting-started.md 

This site will explore new language and old languages, with a focus on frameworks and web development. Examples include [python / flask](http://getting-started.md/guides/1-python-flask), [ruby / sinatra](http://getting-started.md/guides/2-ruby-sinatra), elixir, clojure, go, and rust along with classics like php and java.


## Contributors wanted

The entire getting-started.md project is open source. I encourage people to send PRs for the site and the guides.
